Assignment 1.01 - Dungeon Generation -
-Program generates a random dungeon in the terminal with rooms and hallways.

Assignment 1.02 - File save/load -
-Program can save and load different dungeons using command line arguments, program can also still generate random dungeons.

Assignment 1.03 - Pathfinding -
-Updated the program to generate a distance map from the source player. The first map is generated without taking into account the hardness of the dungeon rock. The second map finds the best tunneling path for monsters using the dungeon hardness.

Assignment 1.04 - Player character and Monsters -
-Updated the program to allow the player character to move randomly around the dungeon while the monsters follow the player according to the distance map. 
-Game is over when either there are no more monsters left in the dungeon (player wins) or the player is killed by one of the monsters (player loses)
-Game is turn based

Assignment 1.05 - User interface with Ncurses -
I am now using Professor Sheaffer's code solution for assignment 1.05. I added a user interface display using the ncurses library. I also added stairs which generate a new dungeon each time you go up or down. Using the 'm' key on the keyboard will display a list of monsters along with their positions relative to the player. Using the "S" key will save the game to the disk and exit. Player is no longer allowed to tunnel throughout the dungeon. Curses library is used to recieve user input.

Assignment 1.06 - Interfacing with C and C++ - 
I am still using the professors code drop for this assignment. My code does not compile and it consistenly gets undefined reference errors when trying to access c++ methods and other methods.

Assignment 1.07 - Parsing monster files - 
My code is now entirely written in C++ instead of C. The main method in rlg327 reads an input file located in .rlg327 and scans it for monster fields. The program seperates the fields for the different monsters, sets them, and places the monsters into a vector/arraylist. It then prints out all the fields for each monster.

Assignment 1.08 - Loading monsters and objects - 
The program now loads in the monster and object files and successfully prints out the dungeon. The monsters are colored and the objects are scattered randomley throughout the dungeon. Characters cannot pick up the weapons yet, they can just walk over them.

Assignment 1.09 - PC Equipment and Updated Combat - 
Program now allows the player to pickup different objects throughout the map. The game now lasts more than one round because hitpoints are implemented. The monsters do an amount of damage based on the dice object inside of them. They roll the dice each time an attack takes place. Pressing I will display the inventory list and it will allow you to display a description about the item. I am using the Professors code for this assignment.

Assignment 1.10 - Choosing your own assignment - 
I took the program we have been making this semester and I put it on an Android device. There are still plenty of bugs but I think I will continue to develop the project for fun.
